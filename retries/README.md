The purpose of this directory is retrying problems. I do it in a separate directory for several reasons, but in general, is just easier.

1. **Avoid getting hints from Git**. The IDE highlights parts of the code that are new and doens't highlight parts of the code that don't change. I might use the non-changing parts as hints to know if my implementation is on the right track. 
2. There is no need to comment previous implementations.

## Testing
Copy the unit tests files from the current implementations if they have them.

Given an array A[] containing N pairs in the form of (X, Y). Where X and Y denote the student’s name and marks respectively. Then your task is to output the maximum average marks of a student.

Examples:

    Input: A[] = {{“Bob”, “87”}, {“Mike”, “35”}, {“Bob”, “52”}, {“Jason”, “35”}, {“Mike”, “55”}, {“Jessica”, “99”}}
    Output: 99
    Explanation: The average marks of each student are as follows:

        Bob: (87+52)/2 = 139/2 = 69
        Mike: (35+55)/2 = 90/2 = 45
        Jason: (35/1) = 35
        Jessica: (99/1) = 99

    Input: A[] = {{“Pradeep”, “54”}, { “Neeraj”, “67”}, { “Sheetal”, “34”}}
    Output: 67
    Explanation: It can be verified that the maximum average marks will be 67.
